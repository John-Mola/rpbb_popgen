# README

**CAUTION** Results sensitive to lat-long for users of this dataset will be slightly different than the published version due to the need to obscure coordinates of collections of an endangered species. If precise reproducibility is required, and necessary credentials/permits are held by the research team, exact coordinates can be provided upon request. 


## EXPLANATION OF FILES AND DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

This repository is intended to document the code behind the project "Range-wide genetic analysis of an endangered bumble bee (Bombus affinis) reveals population structure, isolation by distance, and low colony abundance". The code is all written in R. 

Anyone who downloads this repository should be able to reconstruct the results of the analysis. Two steps require downloading software outside of R: COLONY and STRUCTURE. Included within these scripts are the input steps to feed into these pieces of software, and then the wrangling steps to take the output and wrangle it in R. The scripts indicate when you will need to run these analyses outside of R, but for convenience all outputs of COLONY and STRUCTURE are provided. 

The scripts are all intended to be run in alpha-numerical order (e.g. 01a, 01b, 02a, 02a01, ...). Occassionally scripts have oddly long sub-prefixes (e.g. 02a01b...), this exists simply because I had some prior branch, but the idea is still the same, if you sort by name, the scripts are in the order they are intended to be run. 

For convenience, this directory has the outputs of all data wrangling and data analysis steps already included (though not all figures, necessarily). To conduct a clean run, you could delete all of the files in data_output and analyses_output, then run everything to yield clean outputs.

data/data_wrangling/

01b_wrangle... -- conducts some basic data cleaning
01c_spatial_data... - cluster into putative populations
01d_merge_genotype... - combine genotype data with specimen metadata

analyses/

02a01_preparing... -- filters and prepares data for COLONY program
02c01_batch... -- further prepares a batch run (i.e. all putative pops separately) for COLONY

[intermediate steps run in COLONY]

03a_create_geneind ... -- creates a genind object from the output of COLONY and for use in estimation of pop-gen statistics
03a01_quality... -- checks HWE, LD, etc
03a02_genetic... -- calculates F-statistics, allelic richness, etc from genind object
03a03_Fst_calc... -- runs models to check pairwise Fst across range
03b_diploid... -- counts frequency of diploid males
03c_capwire... -- runs genetic mark-recapture on COLONY output to determine colony abundance
03d_colony_site... -- compares B. affinis worker:colony ratios to those from Cameron et al. 2011
03e_STRUCTURE... -- prepares data to be run in program STRUCTURE, which is run externally, and then wrangles the data after STRUCTURE outputs are produced
03f_AMOVA... -- runs AMOVA procedure
03g_dapc... -- runs DAPC procedure

figures/figure_wrangling

04a_... -- generates Figure 1 map
04a_figure_supplement... -- generates supplemental map
